STM32F072 Breakout Board
========================

![Mounted PCB](pcb.jpg)

This is a small breakout board for the STM32F072 MCU in a LQFP48
package.  I wanted something that would make it easier to try things
out with a small STM2F07 MCU and this PCB is the result.  This PCB
should also work with the STM32F042 MCU and maybe even other STM MCUs
in the same package, but I have not tested that.

Features
--------

* A Micro USB for powering the board and communicating with a host

* All other I/O pins are routed to a 2.54mm pin header

* A voltage regulator which provides VDD

* VIO and VDDA are normally provided from VDD via 0Î© resistors, but
  can optionally be provided externally via a pin header

* RESET and BOOT buttons

* A power LED which shows when the PCB is powered

* A user programmable LED which is connected to I/O pin PA10 (optional)

* PCB is 2 layers and smaller than 50x50mm and so ordering from China
  will only cost about $10 + shipping for 10 PCBs.
